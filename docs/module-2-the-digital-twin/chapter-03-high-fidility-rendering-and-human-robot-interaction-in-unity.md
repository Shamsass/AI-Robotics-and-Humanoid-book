## 🎨 High-Fidelity Rendering in Unity

High-fidelity rendering focuses on **visual realism** and accurate perception modeling.

### 🔧 Key Features

* **HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline)**
  Delivers cinematic-quality lighting, shadows, and reflections.
* **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**
  Realistic materials for robots and environments.
* **Real-time lighting & shadows**
  Essential for vision-based robotics.
* **Camera simulation**
  RGB, depth, stereo, and semantic cameras.
* **Environmental effects**
  Fog, reflections, weather, and motion blur.

✅ Enables realistic **synthetic data generation** for vision and AI training.

## 🤝 Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) in Unity

Unity provides tools to simulate **natural interaction between humans and robots**.

### 🧍 Human Modeling

* Animated human avatars
* Realistic motion and gestures
* Full-body IK and skeletal animation

### 🧠 Interaction Methods

* Gesture recognition
* Voice commands
* Gaze tracking
* Touch and proximity interaction

### 🥽 XR Integration

* **VR / AR / MR** support
* Hand tracking
* Controller-based interaction
* Spatial awareness for shared human-robot spaces

## 🔁 Integration with Robotics Systems

Unity often connects to **ROS / ROS 2** using:

* ROS–TCP Connector
* DDS bridges
* Custom network interfaces

This allows:

* Real robot state visualization
* Human commands sent to robots
* Closed-loop simulation

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

* Training robots in realistic environments
* Evaluating robot behavior around humans
* Designing collaborative robots (cobots)
* Simulating social robots
* Creating digital twins

## ✅ Why Unity for HRI?

✔ Photorealistic environments
✔ Real-time interaction
✔ Strong XR ecosystem
✔ Easy human avatar integration
✔ Scalable from simulation to deployment
