title: Chapter 01 Physics Simulation and environment building
---

Physics simulation and environment building are core parts of modern robotics development. They allow robots to be tested, trained, and validated in a virtual world before being deployed in the real world, saving time, cost, and risk.
Physics simulation and environment building create a realistic virtual world for robots.
They enable accurate testing of control, perception, and intelligence, forming a critical bridge between theory and real-world robotics 🤖
