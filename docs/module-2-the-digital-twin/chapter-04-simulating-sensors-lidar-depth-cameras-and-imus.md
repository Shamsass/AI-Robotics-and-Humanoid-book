Simulating sensors: LiDAR,Depth Cameraas and IMUSSimulating LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs allows robots to perceive the virtual world just like the real one. Accurate sensor simulation is critical for testing perception, localization, navigation, and control algorithms before deploying on physical robots.

Simulating LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs enables realistic robot perception in virtual environments. It ensures perception and control algorithms behave reliably before real-world deployment 🤖
