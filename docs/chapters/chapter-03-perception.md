Perception in Physical AI and robotics refers to a robot’s ability to sense, interpret, and understand its environment so it can act intelligently in the physical world. It is the foundation that enables robots to recognize objects, detect obstacles, track movement, understand human gestures, and navigate complex surroundings.

Robotic perception integrates multiple sensor systems—such as cameras, LiDAR, depth sensors, microphones, tactile sensors, and proprioceptive feedback—with advanced AI algorithms. These include computer vision, sensor fusion, machine learning, and neural networks that allow robots to convert raw sensory data into meaningful information.
