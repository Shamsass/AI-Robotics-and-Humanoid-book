title: "Chapter 1 : Foundation of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics"
---

The foundation of Physical AI lies in creating artificial systems that can sense, think, and act in the physical world with human-like adaptability and intelligence. Unlike traditional AI, which exists mostly in software, Physical AI integrates computational intelligence with mechanical bodies, enabling robots to interact safely and effectively with their surroundings.

Humanoid robotics represents one of the most advanced applications of Physical AI. A humanoid robot is designed to imitate the structure, motion, and behavior of the human body. These robots combine mechanics, actuators, sensors, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms to perform tasks such as walking, grasping, balancing, and understanding human commands.
