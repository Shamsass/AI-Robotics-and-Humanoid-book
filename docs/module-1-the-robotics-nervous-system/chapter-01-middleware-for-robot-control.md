title: Chapter 01 Middleware for robot control
---

Middleware for robot control acts as an intermediary that hides hardware complexity and provides standardized services so that different software modules can work together reliably and efficiently. It allows developers to focus on robot behavior, algorithms, and intelligence instead of low-level device handling.

In a robotic system, multiple components—such as sensors, actuators, controllers, planners, and user interfaces—must exchange data continuously and in real time. Middleware manages this interaction by offering communication mechanisms, hardware abstraction, and system services that ensure smooth operation.
