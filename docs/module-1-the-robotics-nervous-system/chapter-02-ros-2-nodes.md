title: Chapter 02 ROS 2 Nodes
---

Middleware for robot control is a software layer that sits between robot hardware (sensors, actuators, motors) and high-level applications (AI, planning, user interfaces). Its main job is to simplify communication, coordination, and control in robotic systems.

ROS 2 nodes are independent software components that work together to control a robot. They enable modular design, efficient communication, and scalable robotic systems.
