title: Chapter 04 Path planning for bipedial humanoid movement
---

Path planning for bipedal humanoid robots is more complex than wheeled robots because it involves dynamic balance, stability, and gait coordination in addition to obstacle avoidance and navigation.
Path planning for bipedal humanoids combines footstep planning, trajectory optimization, and balance control.
It ensures collision-free, dynamically stable movement over complex terrains, enabling humanoid robots to walk, run, and interact in human-like environments 🤖

If you want, I can draw a detailed diagram showing humanoid path planning from environment to joint control to make this process visually clear
